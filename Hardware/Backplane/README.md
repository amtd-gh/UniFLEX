This is the backplane for the CPU09 system. It has space for 7 slots.
First entry, little remark, this version has not yet been build. However I believe it to be correct.
It has a ATX style power connector. Remote reset button, local fuse as the boards (CPU/MON/IDE) use about 0.8A max.
An ATX power supply can deliver enough current in the 5 Volt to create fireworks on errors.
