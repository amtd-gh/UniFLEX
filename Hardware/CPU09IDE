The CPU09IDE card serves as a DMA driven interface for the CPU09 system with a IDE/PATA disk. 4 22V10 GAL's serve as glue logic.
It has a 40 pin connector that directly interfaces to the disk drive. The memory map of the card is 32 bytes of which the first 16
correspond to the 8 registers that an IDE/PATA disk exposes. The access is 16 bits, but in PIO mode the upper 8 bits are discarded.
The upper 16 bytes hold the 16 bit address register, the extended address and control register and a status register. 
The card format is Eurocard (160x100mm) and has a DIN41612 a-c connector.
