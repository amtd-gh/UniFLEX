The CPU09IOP is in it's early stage. The board has been designed, made, populated and has undergone preliminary tests. So far so good.
No real errors found yet. I am waiting my programmer board and components that allows me to program my 28C64 PROM for this board. 
I have assembled the IOP code already and the hex file is waiting. On the kernel side, I created a special kernel version for the
IOP board with the proper driver. I also created the extra device entries in the /dev directory.

I made a special version of a monitor program for the IOP. I used my test board for the CU09SR4 to give it a serial port. 
So I could test both sides of the dual-port RAM that connects the two worlds together. And yes, the interrupt from the dual-port 
RAM works for both cpu's
