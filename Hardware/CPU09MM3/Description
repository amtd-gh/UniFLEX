This CPU card is driven by a HD63C09 running at 4 MHz bus clocks. The card has extra hardware for System/User state distinction,
a DATBOX that can hold the maps for up to 64 processes (each 16 x 4K), a task latch that can be set for the active task and
a single bit Kernel/Usertask selection. This results in a very efficient context switching. 3 22V10 GAL's are used for glue logic.
It has a timer that expires when interrupts stop coming and that will end the running task and recover the OS from it. At last
it has hardware to establish if the CPU entered the recent interrupt in 6309 or 6809 mode, so the OS can run in 6309 mode and
if a user task modifies the CPU mode, the kernel can take correct action when an interrupt occurs.
The card format is Eurocard (160x100mm) and has a DIN41612 a-c connector.

U6 = CPU, U8 = DATBOX(MMU), U17 = TASKLATCH, U9+U19 = STACKCOUNT, U13 = SYSTEM/USER , U18 = KERNEL/USER MAP U16 = INTERRUPT TIMEOUT,
U7 = RESET CIRCUIT/LOGIC, U10/U12/U14 = GAL LOGIC, U1/U2/U3/U4/U5 = BUS BUFFERS,
