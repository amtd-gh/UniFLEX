The CPU09MON card holds a special version of the UniBug ROM, up to 1 MByte of static RAM, an ACIA for system console, a PIA that is
serving as system timer/control and for the LIGHTS feature. The card holds a 4.9152 MHz baud rate oscillator, a /8 signal is fed
over the backplane as common clock for other serial boards and it provides the 100 Hz signal for the system timer.
3 16V8 GAL's serve as glue logic. The board also holds the logic for the BLACKHOLE and WHITEHOLE memory blocks. In this system
BLACKHOLE reads as $3F and triggers a trap when accessed (read or write) in User mode. The WHITEHOLE memory is read-only and
reads as $00. The card format is Eurocard (160x100mm) and has a DIN41612 a-c connector.

I got the rev 1.0 of the MON board, populated it and tested it. Initially it would not work :-(. But after some serious
debugging it came out that the low bank of the 512x8 memory chip was faulty. It had an address line error inside.
After replacement the board works fine!. 

That makes me wonder if I need to revive the famous SWTPC pathalogic memory test version (ROM) for my system. 
It may avoid a lot of troubel...
