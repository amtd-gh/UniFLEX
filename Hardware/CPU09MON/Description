The CPU09MON card holds a special version of the UniBug ROM, up to 1 MByte of static RAM, an ACIA for system console, a PIA that is
serving as system timer/control and for the LIGHTS feature. The card holds a 4.9152 MHz baud rate oscillator, a /8 signal is fed
over the backplane as common clock for other serial boards and it provides the 100 Hz signal for the system timer.
3 16V8 GAL's serve as glue logic. The board also holds the logic for the BLACKHOLE and WHITEHOLE memory blocks. In this system
BLACKHOLE reads as $3F and triggers a trap when accessed (read or write) in User mode. The WHITEHOLE memory is read-only and
reads as $00. The card format is Eurocard (160x100mm) and has a DIN41612 a-c connector.
