Yeah, this board gave me headache's. Not because the design was that difficult but more about 'Murphy' struck a few times here.

My _third_ production attempt is now in the mail......

The board has four 63B50 ACIA's and for each an individual baudrate select: 38400/19200/9600/4800/2400/1200/600/300 baud.
Each port has an MAX233 chip for the RS232 interfacing. The baudrate latch also can activate /CTS in case hardware handshake
is not needed. The IO space for one board is $10, so you can apply a couple of those. You can use them on the UniFLEX side
as well on the IOP side. I would suggest the latter, as the IOP relieves the main CPU here from all the serial device interrupts.
It has one GAL which does everything what is needed.

I need to adapt the UniFLEX kernel drivers for the baudrate select. The same for the IOP code.
