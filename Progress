Status of project is as follows:

CPU09MM3
First design version of CPU board works but lacks HD6309/6809 detection. E clock at 4 MHz. All signals are is expected.
Second design version is finished and ready, I will order them in the coming days. 
The card provides the normal bus signals, DATA and ADDRESS and CONTROL and additionally /VMA, /XFEXX
The memory mapper can store 64 maps of 16 memory pages each.

CPU09MON
First design version of MONitor board showed some weaknesses in the design. Made a second design version which is in the mail.
I dropped the parallel port and used it for the 'LIGHTS' function, 8 LEDS that are togled in various parts of the kernel code.
I placed the master baudrate clock on this board, it can be transferred over the backplane to i.e. CPU09SR4.
It has two RAM chips 512Kx8, one ROM 8Kx8, an ACIA, a PIA for timer control and 'LIGHTS', Xtal clock for baudrate(s), hardware
for BLACKHOLE and WHITEHOLE. In user mode any access to this memory region results in a trap and end of user process.
The ROM can be hardware or software selected as 4 images of 2Kbyte each. So one image could be a MIKBUG compatible monitor
where another could be UniBUG and a third SBUG.

CPU09IDE
First design proved to be working but now I understand more about the IDE interface and with some IDE disks I found that
I had to improve some things, The second design version is in the mail too.
PIO works, DMA works. Some IDE disks do a DMA in one single cycle, but others break it up in 2 or 3 parts: first is 510 bytes,
second is one byte and the last is one byte too. The DMA state machine can handle all. 

CPU09SR4
First design version of the 4 port serial card is ready. It has place  for 4 ACIA devices. Each ACIA have a software controllable
baudrate selection: 38k4, 19k2, 9k6, 4k8, 2k4, 1k2, 0k6 and 0k3. When it is time for it I will order the proto version.

CPU09IOP
First design version of the serial character devices IOP (IOprocessor) is ready. When it is time for it I will order the proto version.
When finished the IOP should be able to control a couple of CPU09SR4 boards.

CPU09SPI
First design version of the SPI board is ready. It can be used with the W5500 network component or with a SD card reader.
The SPI interface is to work with DMA to a local processor (HD63C09) and the data can be transferred to the OS via a 1Kx8 
dual-port RAM. When it is time for it I will order the proto version.

CPU09BP
The design for the backplane is ready. As I have a compatible backplane from the 80's I can wait for the first proto version.
During the last months a few times the design had improved and reworked. It is place for a ATX style power connector
and 7 slots for boards. It could fit in an 19" rack. I expect soon to order the prototypes.

On the software side I am thinking about how to bring up a simple system. With a minimal filesystem and programs.
On Linux I can create a fresh UniFLEX filesystem as a file. I used Evenson's SWTPC emulator to check my results and that helped me.
Sad thing is that the Evenson's Emulator sometimes just dies.....
As I can mount this or any UniFLEX filesystem with FUSE on Linux, the building process can be automated with scripts. The biggest hurdle
is to get it on the IDE disk easily. But I have a few ways to try. 

I have a LOT of fun with my GAL programming hardware and software. I rewrote the GALBLAST.C code in PERL and designed hardware that
can switch the supply voltages and the programming voltages. It works with a normal PC parallel port and also with _SOME_ USB<->IEE1284
dongles. I made a separate GitHub archive for it. 
In the near future I will post both hardware and software on GitHub.

2019-07-22:

I believe the CPU09MMU board reached it's final revision. The current version, with minor corrections works as expected.
The second version of the CPU09MON board also works as designed, only have to wait the HD63B21 devices to complete all tests.
The CPU09IDE current version works, with to much wires, as desired. It does DMA very well, can cope with special behaveour of some
IDE disks. Now it is time to complete the unibug rom version for this hardware and try to bring up a (very small) filesystem.
